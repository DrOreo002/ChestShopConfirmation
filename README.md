# Modifying
If you're a server owner with a paid developer and would like to update this to the latest version I'd not recommend you to modify this source. The system of this plugin is really easy to replicate and its much more worth the time to make a new one. Because this plugin depends on OreoCore and the code isn't that good and not optimized well, so please consider it.
